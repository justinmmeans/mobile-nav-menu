# The Installation Process

Philly Community Wireless works with PhillyWisper, a wireless internet service provider, who installs rooftop antennas that we use to provide a free wifi network to the neighborhood residents and public spaces.

If you live in a two-three story house, or in an larger apartment building, and we can receive access to your roof, we can install non-penetrating roof mounts and run cables into your home to install a wifi access point. 

Installations can sometimes take an extended period of time to schedule. We are slowly growing out our network, and we appreciate your patience and assistance as we build the foundations.

# Getting Wifi Quickly

If you live within the range of our wifi network, we can bring you a mesh kit, like a hotspot or wifi extender, that we can easily install in your home on a short-term basis. If you need wifi in your home, please contact us specifically about getting a mesh kit.
