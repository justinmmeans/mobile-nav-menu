Philly Community Wireless (PCW) is a collective impact initiative consisting of allied community organizations based in the neighborhoods of Fairhill and Kensington. We are building community-owned and -operated internet infrastructures in order to democratize access, promote digital literacy, and fight digital inequity with free, net-neutral broadband service in North Philadelphia.

Through funding from the Independence Public Media Foundation and the Digital Literacy Alliance at the Mayor’s Fund for Philadelphia, PCW seeks a full-time Project Manager to lead this volunteer-driven initiative over the next two years as we partner with nonprofits, local businesses, and immigrant/LEP communities in the Norris Square Park neighborhood to develop an alternative model of community-based network stewardship. 

The Project Manager will collaborate with PCW’s allied institutions like the Free Library of Philadelphia, Called To Serve CDC, PhillyWisper, HACE CDC, and The University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, and Princeton University. The Project Manager will also oversee and collaborate with PCW’s Community Engagement Liaison, who works with community partners like West Kensington Ministry, Norris Square Community Alliance (NSCA), and Norris Square Neighborhood Project (NSNP).
