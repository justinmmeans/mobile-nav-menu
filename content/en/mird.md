Mir is the full-time technician at Philly Community Wireless. Their primary work with PCW is doing on-site installation and maintenance work. Their educational background is in Systems Engineering, while their professional background spans from fabrication to batista work to costume design. They enjoy the hands-on, troubleshooting work of building a community-controlled wireless network. The work of directly providing internet accessibility, one radio and one AP at a time, aligns perfectly with Mir's values and philosophy. Outside of work, they have a wide range of interests which include performance, clothes-making, archery, and home improvement.
