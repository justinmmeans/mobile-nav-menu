## Tech

{{% notice %}}
_The tech team is primarily looking for volunteers who can donate time and effort to our installation process: attending in-person trainings and workdays in Norris Square, configuring our networking hardware, and installing equipment in homes and on rooftops. We are all in the process of learning these skills, so you'll be trained in a collaborative environment. Access to a car and/or proximity to Norris Square Park are both great to have._

_However, you're also welcome to get involved in whatever other capacity makes sense for you. These are some of the skill areas we currently / are planning to work in:_
