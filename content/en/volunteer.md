Our network is being built by and for our communities. To get involved, just reach out to one of our team leads based on your area(s) of interest. We are currently looking for volunteers with availability to work on-site and contribute to the installation of hardware. 
## Tech

{{% notice %}}
_The tech team is primarily looking for volunteers who can donate time and effort to our installation process: attending in-person trainings and workdays in Norris Square, configuring our networking hardware, and installing equipment in homes and on rooftops. We are all in the process of learning these skills, so you'll be trained in a collaborative environment. Access to a car and/or proximity to Norris Square Park are both great to have._

_However, you're also welcome to get involved in whatever other capacity makes sense for you. These are some of the skill areas we currently / are planning to work in:_
