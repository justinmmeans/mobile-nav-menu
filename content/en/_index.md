**Philly Community Wireless** (PCW) is building community-owned and -operated internet infrastructures in order to democratize access, promote digital literacy, and fight digital inequity with free, net-neutral broadband service in North Philadelphia.

### We believe that internet access is a human right.

We are currently partnering with residents and nonprofits organizations in **Norris Square Park** to develop a community-owned, free wifi network.

We are seeking community organizations and building owners in Norris Square interested in receiving a free install of a small network antenna on their rooftops to expand the public wifi signal into their neighborhood.
