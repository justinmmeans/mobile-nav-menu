**Philly Community Wireless** (PCW) is building community-owned and -operated internet infrastructures in order to democratize information access, promote digital literacy, and fight digital inequity with free, net-neutral broadband service in North Philadelphia.

### We believe that internet access is a human right.

We are currently partnering with residents and nonprofits organizations in the **Norris Square Park** neighborhood, offering free installations of network antennas on rooftops to expand the public wifi signal around the neighborhood.
