We are a volunteer-led organization building free, community-controlled internet infrastructure in Philadelphia. 

As several ongoing crises worsen the existing inequities in internet access, we aim to bridge the gap by building low-overhead wireless networks that can deliver free access in the short term and, in the long term, be owned and managed by the communities that use them.

We are committed to promoting tech literacy, information access, net neutrality, and digital justice.

### Internet access is a human right.
