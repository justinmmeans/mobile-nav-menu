# Act on Air: The Philly Air Monitor Project

Philly Community Wireless is partnering with other organizations around the city, including the Clean Air Council and Temple University's Geography and Urban Studies Program, to deploy Purple Air Monitors on our network. 

# Measuring Air Quality

Purple Air monitors allow residents to asses:

1. If their air quality is good in their area
2. How it compares to other parts of the city.
