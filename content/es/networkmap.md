To view the map in fullscreen, visit this [webpage](https://phillycommunitywireless.github.io/pcwnetworkmap/). 

Any area covered by the heatmap should have PCW signal available for a free wifi connection. Please keep in mind that the heatmap is not accurate at the street-level, and if you cannot access the wifi network in any given space in the city, you may need to walk around a street corner. Try to find the closest access point visible to ensure a good connection.
