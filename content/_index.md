We are a collective impact initiative consisting of allied community organizations based primarily in the neighborhoods of Fairhill and Kensington. Over the next two years, we are partnering with residents, nonprofits, and immigrant/LEP communities in Norris Square Park to incubate a new model of community-based network stewardship that can spread throughout the City of Philadelphia.
